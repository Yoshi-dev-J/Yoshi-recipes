        <h3>What is French onion soup?</h3>
        <p>French onion soup is a soup usually based on meat stock and onions, and often served gratin√©ed with croutons or a larger piece of bread covered with cheese floating on top. Ancient in origin, the dish underwent a resurgence of popularity in the 1960s in the United States due to a greater interest in French cuisine.</p>
